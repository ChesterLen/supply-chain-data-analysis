📦 Supply Chain Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing supply chain data to extract valuable insights and improve data quality. It demonstrates practical skills in Python and SQL by working with a simulated supply chain dataset containing information about orders, shipments, and delivery times. The project also includes automating SQL queries and building a dashboard to visualize key metrics.

    • Clean and structure the supply chain dataset using Python.
    
    • Perform SQL queries to analyze the dataset and extract insights.
    
    • Identify trends, delays, and areas for improvement.
    
    • Automate SQL queries using Python.
    
    • Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to display key metrics.
